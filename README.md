# Work-Queue
Web app to track works and jobs

### What is this?
This is a web app that keeps track of all your works in office with their status.
It stores all the data in browser local storage and work with no dependency on backend server

### Limitation
Data will be lost as you close the browser.

### Improvement
I have created a new app with server/cloud sync and team collaboration option at ![ppml38/Work-Queue-Server](https://github.com/ppml38/Work-Queue-Server)
